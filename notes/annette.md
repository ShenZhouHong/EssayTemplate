# Annette F. Timm Notes
> Sex with a Purpose: Prostitution, Venereal Disease, and Militarized Masculinity in the Third Reich

* Nazism is not *merely* sexually repressive. That is a simplistic stance.

## The Lebensborn Program
* Initiated by the ReichsfÃ¼hrer SS, **Heinrich Himmler**.
* Seen as the personal 'pet project" of Himmler, to the extent that interference by other leaders was explicitly criticized.
    * See Hans Peter Bleuel, Sexand Societyin Nazi Germany,ed. Heinrich Fraenkel, trans. J. Maxwell Brownjohn (Philadelphia, 1973), 170-71.

> Himmler was quick to warn others away from interfering in what he saw as his domain. He reacted angrily, for instance, when Leonardo Conti, the Reich director of health, wrote about "Raising the Birth-Rate by Marital Introduction, Marriage Guidance and Fostering."

## Prostitution in Nazi Germany
> Primarily under Himmler's influence, the regime came to accept prostitution as necessary for satisfying male sexual drives, which, if left unsatisfied, would lead men into homosexuality, dampen their fighting spirit, or diminish their labor productivity. 

* During the early years of Nazi Rule, a large amount of effort was payed towards removing "sexually deviant" individuals from society, with a big emphasis on removing the visible signs of prostitution especially during the 1936 Olympics.
    * This serves as an interesting contrast which highlights the contradictions within nazi sexual policy
    * Later on, prostitutes were limited to state-sanctioned brothels, with strict VD checks.

## Birth control
* There was an attempt to make all forms of birth control illegal, and the debate was passed all the way up to the highest levels of the Nazi Government.
* Reportedly, Hitler himself supported the complete ban on birth control.
    * Minutes of meeting of Sachverstandigen Beirat fiir Bevolkerungs und Rassenpolitik, August 3, 1933, in Bundesarchiv Berlin, hereafter BArch(B), R43 II/720a, 120ff.
* However, health experts were concerned about the need to prevent VD with condoms, and ultimately an altered version of the law was passed in 21-01-1941, banning all forms of birth control except for condoms.

## Attitudes towards sexuality
* Rejection of "bourgeois prudery", an ideological stance lead by Himmler.
    * In fact, the SS newspaper Das schwarze Korpswas full of explicit rejections of bourgeois prudery
        *  See Dagmar Herzog, "Sexuelle Revolution und Vergangenheits- bewaltigung," Zeitschriftfiir Sexualforschung13, no. 2 (2000): 87-103.
*  Sexuality is viewed as a means to an end -- that of the establishment of a racially sanitized state -- sexual activity with a national purpose:

> Nazi leaders believed that the state needed to intervene directly in theprivate sexual sphere to make sure that "valuable" male citizens (and othermen temporarily useful as laborers) were sexually satisfied. To some degree, sex was a reward to be doled out to supporters of the regime, and themale's sexual gratification was deemed to take precedence over the female's.

* Sexual gratification was directly equated towards masculine power.

> The regulation of prostitution and the glorification of motherhoodwere both intended to strengthen military prowess, the former by offering sexual rewards to soldiers and war workers, the latter by creating a "fitter" and more numerous population from which to draw a fighting force. 

### Key guiding elements in Nazi Sexual Policy
1. public endorsement of chastity while cracking down on asocial sexual behavior and defining prostitutes as legally marginal; 
2. toleration of extramarital sex, particularly prostitution, as long as it did not offend "public sensibilities"; 
3. subordination of all policies on sexuality and prostitution to the war effort.

### The appearance of chasity
* Stated goal to strengthen the German family against racial degeneration and miscegenation
* Insisting on the sanctity of marriage.
* This appearance of chasity was especially well-kept during the early years of the Nazi regime, where more effort was taken to conform to conservative german ideals.
* Many of the Nazi leaders were praised for their crackdown on "excessive" sexuality, and programs such as the Hitler Youth and the BDM were praised:

> Channeling youthful energies into sports and outdoor activities, according to Johannes Breger, the Berlin head of the German Society for Combating Venereal Disease, would prevent exposure to deviant sexual behavior

* The early-era nazi support for sexual conservatism may also be due to the need for support from the religious elements of the german public, when power was still being consolidated.
