# Robert G. Waite Notes
> Teenage Sexuality in Nazi Germany

* The concept of the **racial community** - that the reproductive elements of a citizen's life are a matter of policy by the state.
* A large focus was placed on the youth in Nazi Germany, especially their moral and sexual development.
    * This can be seen in the importance of state-lead organizations such as the Hiter Youth or the Bundes Deutscher MÃ¤del
    * An atmosphere of concern and moral panic was inherited from the days of the Weimar Republic
        * Read: sexual bolshelvism, 'americanization of German society', 'jewish moral degeneracy'

## An atmosphere of mixed messages
* At the beginning of the Nazi rule over Germany, an attempt was made to restrain the percieved moral and sexual degeneracy inherited from the Weimar Republic
* The primary concern of early policy-makers were that of sexual crimes and sexual assault in the German youth
* Youngers introduced to new environments such as the workplace, labour camps, or the Hitler Youth were removed from parental supervision, resulting in a greater sense of freedom and hence, sexual experimentation.
