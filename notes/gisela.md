> Racism and Sexism in Nazi Germany: Motherhood,Compulsory Sterilization, and the Stat

## The value of 'Scientific Racism'
* The concept of 'scientific racism' was prevalent in early pre-WWI Germany, where the euthanasia of those who posess hereditary forms of inferority (erbliche Minderwertigkeit) was advocated
    * These ideals were encapsulated in Hitler's concept of the racial state, where a state can be strengthened through racial purity

## Nazi Body Politics
* In order to implement the ideals of Hitler's 'racial state', laws were passed in order to limit the births of the 'inferior', and to encourage births of those that are seen as racially hygenic
    * In 1933, laws were introduced to limit the availability of abortion facilities, as well as to increase conviction rates for violations of Weimar Republic's antiabortion laws. This resulted in a 65 percent increase in yearly convictions betwewen 1932 and 1938
        * Doctors and midwifes were obliged inform the regional state health office of every miscarriage, with suspicious situations investigated by the criminal police
        * In 1936, Heinrich Himmler established a Reich's Central Agency for the Struggle against Homosexuality and Abortion"
* Germany under Nazism implemented a coherent policy of sexism and racism, where motherhood was compulsory for some, and prohibited for others.
